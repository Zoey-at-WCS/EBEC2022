# Evolutionary Biology and Ecology of Cancer 2022

## Course overview
Cancers are an evolving ecosystem of cells, and so knowledge of evolution and ecology is important to understand and clinically control cancer. Unfortunately, there are few cancer biologists trained in these disciplines. This course aims to bridge that gap, facilitate cross-fertilisation of ideas, and provide hands-on training in the application of tools from evolution and ecology to cancer.

This year’s programme will highlight various modelling (e.g. agent-based, game theory), ecological, phylogenetic and digital pathology tools used in cancer research. Participants will gain knowledge of evolutionary biology as applied to the somatic cell evolution in cancer, as well as the principles of ecology relevant to studying tumour microenvironments and immune selection. We also discuss the application of evo-eco principles in the design of novel clinical trials.

The course is suited to researchers interested in understanding cancer from an evolutionary and ecological perspective. Applications are invited from early-career scientists, including PhD students, postdoctoral fellows and new principal investigators.
